# seven-words
a silly "sentence generator" in datalog

**NOTE**: I've only tested this with Soufflé and I think they do some things differently to how other datalog thingies might work. so yeah.

**ALSO NOTE**: This was really just an experiment and hasn't been properly tested

## HOW TO USE
* Compile all the datalog with Soufflé
* Use `words2facts.py` to convert a plaintext document into "facts" that Soufflé can deal with
* Use `sentence` to start generating "sentences"
    * Sentences are 7 words long
    * They are generated by "chaining up" bigrams from the input
    * They cannot be an existing sevengram
    * There are some limitations on how often a word can repeat, this is to stop getting things like "yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah" as a "sentence"
* The final output will be in sentence.csv, it might be littered with \r and other stuff so you might want to clean that up

## TODO
* Neaten up some of the code and put in comments where needed
* Write a script to automate the whole proccess

## ISSUES
* It doesn't care at all about newlines or punctuation, leading to weird results, but also the results are weird anyway.
