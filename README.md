# seven-words
a silly "sentence generator" in datalog

Also included: the lyrics to "Down Under" by "Men at Work" as a fact file for testing if you wanted.

**NOTE**: I've only tested this with Soufflé and I think they do some things differently to how other datalog thingies might work. so yeah.
**ALSO NOTE**: This was really just an experiment and hasn't been properly tested

## HOW TO USE
* Compile all the datalog with Soufflé
* Use `words2facts.py` to convert a plaintext document into "facts" that the Soufflé datalog implementation can deal with.
* Use `n-gram` to find all the bigrams and 7grams in the text, these will be output in `bigram.csv` and `sevengram.csv` respectivly
* Change the file extension from `csv` to `facts`
* Use `sentence` to start generating its own "sentences"
    * Sentences are 7 words long
    * They are generated by "chaining up" bigrams
    * They cannot be an existing sevengram
* The final output will be in sentence.csv, it might be littered with ^M's and quote marks so you might want to clean that up

## TODO
* Neaten up some of the code and put in comments where needed
* Write a script to automate the whole proccess

## ISSUES
* It doesn't care at all about newlines or punctuation, leading to weird results, but also the results are weird anyway.
